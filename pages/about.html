		<h1>Thought Process</h1>
		<p>The human mind - that compendium of thought processes forming one’s self - is at the center of my practice. When developing thoughts, the mind creates a constant flow of mental imagery, sounds and patterns. I am interested in the potential of these systems as aesthetic languages, specifically in the formation of audiovisual artworks. In my artistic practice I explore the mutual and divergent characteristics between the physical and psychological realms of thinking and audio-visual technologies: similarly non-linear, fleeting, and absorptive systems. I attempt to visualise, and in some cases reimagine, the very personal space of one’s inner dialogue.</p>
    <p>Through producing complex, sensory multimedia installations in site-specific locations, the environments I create address the futility of capturing that ephemeral thing called thought. These artworks not only address cognition directly, they are also an experiment into the mediums of sound and video.</p>
