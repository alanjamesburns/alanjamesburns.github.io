		<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
		<p>In developing thoughts, the human mind relies heavily on sound, visuals and patterns. Our inner voice is, as such, a constant systematic flow of words and pictures. Used as an aesthetic language, words and pictures also form the core material components in audiovisual artworks. In my
artistic practice, I explore the characteristics of both thinking and audiovisual technologies: similarly non-linear, fleeting, and absorptive systems. My practice examines the crossover potential between these physical and mental realms. Using the cognitive mechanisms of audio and video
material, I attempt to visualise, convey and, in some cases alter, the very personal space of one’s inner dialogue. The idea of the human mind as
a compendium of thought processes, creating one’s identity, is at the centre of my practice.</p>
<p>I primarily produce intricate multimedia installations in site-specific locations. Creating complex sensory environments, my work addresses the
futility of capturing the ephemerality that is thought. My work is not only an experiment into the understanding of cognition, but also an experiment into the medium of video, and its possibilities to further our understanding of human thought.</p>
