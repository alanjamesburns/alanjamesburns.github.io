		<p>The human mind - that compendium of thought processes forming one’s <em>self</em> - is at the centre of my practice. When developing thoughts, the human consciousness flows with ‘inner’ imagery, sounds and patterns. I am interested in the potential of these systems as aesthetic languages, specifically in the formation of audiovisual artworks. In my artistic practice, I explore the characteristics of thinking with audio-visual technologies: similarly non-linear, fleeting, and absorptive systems. I attempt to visualise, and in some cases reimagine, the very personal space of one’s inner dialogue.</p>
    <p>Through producing complex, sensory multimedia installations in site-specific locations, I create environments which address the futility of capturing that ephemeral thing called <em>thought</em>. The artworks not only address cognition directly, they are also an experiment into the mediums of sound and video.</p>
