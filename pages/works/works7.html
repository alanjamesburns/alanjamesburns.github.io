    <h1>and a pitched note falls</h1>
    <p>5.1 audio channel intermittent sound installation. The LAB, Dublin. 2013.
The soudn of a drinking glass vibrates with ascending pitch in a anti clockwise movement.
A sequence of sounds are created that appear to swirl and fall through the gallery.
The work was part of the three person show: <em>At the level of entity</em>.

<p>“In fact, thinking about physical processes as a marker against which to
determine time and space measures permeates the exhibition whole.
Frequencies emanate from those places existing between the works. The void parts, where no works physically exist, are calculated by the accents that extend themselves between the works. Alan-James Burns’ sound structure measures the volume of the venue. A gravitating and rotational pull is
perceived by the observer relative to their position to the source of the echo.”</p>

<p>“In those places where atmosphere is physically manifested, it is coloured by the way that material identity defines the limitations of space; by the way that it focuses our attention on spatial distinctiveness. This is
universally recognisable in sound, which endlessly seems to test the qualities of space. However, since its only medium is the vibration of air, sound evades classifications of formal style – its physical makeup never changes. As such, there is a type of universal agreement among species that it is the preferred media of language; even where it wants to signal nothing, it is still wrapped in the echo of every deliberate signal that is now past.</p>

<div class="works-text col-xs-12">
  <h1></h1>
<p>That observation is only partially relevant in a world where machine-produced sounds are equally as prevalent as organic sounds. These
mechanical utterances carry their own privileged types of meaning: they can alert, imitate, or entertain. Mechanical sound is conspicuously
informational. With all of this ‘signal weight’, the spatial and sonic artifice can quickly become clouded with prompts, which collectively say one thing and the other in the same breath: paradoxes, collusions of sound that are logically unacceptable.</p>
<p>But whatever its origin, sound shares crucial properties with light and mist: it is constituted in a way that thrives on instant disintegration, it can overtake the logical mind with an immersion of superior weight and volume. And, it is hardly a physical construct: to the eye and hand, it is immaterial.”</p>
