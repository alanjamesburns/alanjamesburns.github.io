    <h1>and many stones fall  </h1>
    <p>Intermittent 6 channel sound installation, Variable lenght. Sailor’s Home on O’Curry Street, Limerick, Ireland 2014.</p>
    <p>Sounds of falling stones bounce and reverberate around a three story unused building. Audience memebrs hear stones fall through space from upper floors into the gallery on ground level before settling in an imagined basement.</p>
    <p>Stone Soup was a residency/exhibition/event curated by Basic Space, on
invitation by Ormston House and Limerick City of Culture. The residency took place in Sailor's Home on O'Curry Street, Limerick, for the month of July 2014. The space was scattered with lumps of local limestone. The stones and the house form a fulcrum and a framework around and within which art works have claimed a place. During the month artists undertook short working residencies in the Sailors’ Home and contributing to an unfolding and expanding exhibition. The residency was punctuated by open days during which the work of the artists were seen adapting to the unique location and its imposed conditions with an ever increasing number of surrounding works.</p>
